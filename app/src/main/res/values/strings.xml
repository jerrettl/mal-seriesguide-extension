        Thank you for installing my app!\n\nThis is my first attempt to make an Android app, so if
        there are any issues, please feel free to send me a message! This app was made out of a
        personal desire to get to MyAnimeList faster right from SeriesGuide, so I decided I would
        make this! I\'m sure I\'m not the only person that wanted this, so I shared it with the
        world too! Enjoy!
