# Privacy Policy

I take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy I provide this
privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is
collected and used (or rather, how it isn't).


## Collection of Routine Information

This app stores and collects no information about its users. However, the
third-party API, Jikan, may use some information to function properly. This
includes, but is not limited to, your IP address, search queries, and
timestamps, since they are inherently required for accessing an API. Note that
Jikan may have different privacy policies from my own.


## Links to Third Party Websites

I have included links to MyAnimeList on this app for your use and reference. I
am not responsible for the privacy policies outside of this app. You should be
aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from my own.


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that
no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 19, 2022 and will remain in
effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future,
which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page. I reserve
the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should
check this Privacy Policy periodically. If I make any material changes to this
Privacy Policy, I will notify you by placing a notice on my app.


## Contact Information

For any questions or concerns regarding the privacy policy, please send me an
email at longworthjerrett@gmail.com.
